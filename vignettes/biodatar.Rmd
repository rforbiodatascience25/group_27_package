## Introduction
`biodatar` is an educational R package that illustrates the **central dogma of molecular biology**, showing how genetic information flows from **DNA → RNA → Protein**.

It contains five functions and one dataset (`codon_table`) that allow users to generate random DNA sequences, transcribe them into RNA, translate them into proteins, and visualize amino acid frequencies.  

This package was developed as part of the *R for Bio Data Science* course at DTU.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `generate_dna()`
Generates a random DNA sequence of a specified length.

```r
dna <- generate_dna(15)
dna
#> "ATGGCTTATCGTGAC"
````

### 2. `dna_to_rna()`

Transcribes DNA into RNA by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U).

```r
rna <- dna_to_rna(dna)
rna
#> "AUGGCUUAUCGUGAC"
```

### 3. `split_into_codons()`

Splits an RNA sequence into codons (groups of 3 nucleotides).

```r
codons <- split_into_codons(rna)
codons
#> "AUG" "GCU" "UAU" "CGU" "GAC"
```

### 4. `translate_codons()`

Translates RNA codons into amino acids using the internal `codon_table`.

```r
protein <- translate_codons(codons)
protein
#> "MAYRD"
```

### 5. `plot_protein()`

Plots the frequency of amino acids in a protein sequence using **ggplot2** and **stringr**.

```r
plot_protein(protein)
```

This creates a bar plot showing the number of occurrences of each amino acid.

## Workflow Example

The following pipeline demonstrates how the functions can be combined to model the **central dogma**:

```r
dna <- generate_dna(30)
rna <- dna_to_rna(dna)
codons <- split_into_codons(rna)
protein <- translate_codons(codons)
plot_protein(protein)
```

Result: A complete simulation of transcription and translation, ending with a visualization of the resulting protein composition.

## Use Cases

* Teaching the molecular biology concepts of transcription and translation.
* Demonstrating how to build an R package.
* Simulating random DNA, RNA, or protein sequences for educational purposes.
* Providing a foundation for developing more advanced bioinformatics tools.

## Group Discussion Summary (Task 3)

* Each function models a specific step in the **central dogma**.
* Dependencies (`ggplot2`, `stringr`) were added with `usethis::use_package()`.
* It’s good practice to **limit dependencies** to keep packages lightweight and stable.
* The team discussed that sometimes dependencies are **necessary** for efficiency and readability (e.g., `ggplot2` for visualization).
* `package::function()` is preferred over `@importFrom` because it makes code origins explicit and avoids namespace conflicts.
